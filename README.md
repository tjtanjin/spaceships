### Introduction
SpaceShips (Local Version) is a classic arcade style game with numerous enemy types, bosses and powerups! While working on my first project ([Age Of Empire](https://github.com/tjtanjin/age_of_empire)), I began to have ideas of including graphics into my game. Having no prior experience, I decided to pick up pygame which led me to learn to create a simple space game!

Note: SpaceShips has since received a playable online web version (with additional features!) whose work can be found in this repository:
```

```

### Features
SpaceShips (Local Version) runs locally on your computer and has options for the following gamemodes:
```
1) Single Player
2) Two Player
```
Fight your way through different enemies and bosses! Collect powerups to help you along the way! There is strategy in the game so think hard!
